This is the readme.

to-do:
    create snapshot class.
    have button save snapshots.
    have snapshotholder display snapshots. (have canvas extend downward with each snapshot.)
    have empty, dead cells be a color that stains
        the once living cell's remains (colors fade after dying)
    implement some sharing or saving feature.
    implement about and refresh buttons.
    reimplement generations / possibly have generations be a timer. 300th generation = refresh. or just implement a timer that starts when one generation = another / one generation = two generations back. (there is no real change in the system.)
