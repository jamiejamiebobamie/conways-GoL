// a ball has...
// a radius
// an x and y
// a velocity = 2d vector
// a speed = magnitude of velocity

// cells the ball touches die, but cells that the ball is adjacent to live
// speed of generations = some result of ball(s) speed

// balls can be dragged and released (thrown)
// balls bounce off the sides of the canvas

// the bottom of the canvas has the title, is grid-less, and stores the balls at the beginning of the game.

// balls can bounce off other balls


// issues: mouseDrag conferring velocity
// ball physics
